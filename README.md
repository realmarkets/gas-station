# IOTA Gas Station

IOTA Gas Station is a component that powers sponsored transactions on IOTA at scale. It manages a database of gas coins owned
by a sponsor address and provides APIs to reserve gas coins and use them to pay for transactions. It achieves
scalability and high throughput by managing a large number of gas coin objects in the pool, so that it can sponsor a
large number of transactions concurrently.

## Documentation

For complete documentation, visit this [link](https://docs.iota.org/operator/gas-station/).

## How to run with Docker

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the IOTA Gas Station Repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/gas-station
```

2. **Navigate to the Docker Directory and Generate the Config File:**

```sh
cd gas-station/docker
../utils/./gas-station-tool.sh generate-sample-config --config-path config.yaml --docker-compose -n testnet
```

   **Note:** If the generated private key pair doesn’t meet your requirements, replace it with your own keys.

3. **Set Up Authentication:** Define a bearer token for the Gas Station API using the `GAS_STATION_AUTH` environment variable. If set, this token must be provided in all requests to the Gas Station, except for the `/` and `/version` endpoints. It can also be omitted to disable default authentication, e.g. if one wants to add a custom authentication to the server. In this case, requests against the Gas Station can be made without an authentication token.

4. **Start the Gas Station**

```sh
GAS_STATION_AUTH=[bearer_token] docker compose up
```


### Expected Output

When the gas station starts, it will perform the initial coin-splitting procedure. You should see logs similar to the following:

```log

### API

Your Gas Station instance should now be running and accessible via its [HTTP API](https://docs.iota.org/operator/gas-station/api-reference/).

## How to build

### Build prerequisites

#### Gas Station reinitialization

The configuration parameter `target-init-balance` requires the Redis database to be cleared (flushed) before any changes to those settings can take effect safely. If you modify these parameters, you will typically be notified that a reinitialization is required. To prevent accidental or unintended reinitializations — which may take a significant amount of time — you must explicitly start the gas station with the `--allow-reinit` flag to allow automatic reinitialization. Alternatively, you can revert the changed parameters to their original values and plan the reinitialization for a more convenient time.

#### Signer Configuration

You can configure the signer in two ways:

- **Local (hardcoded) key** _(unsafe)_

   **Example**:

   ```yaml
   local:
      keypair: AKT1Ghtd+yNbI9fFCQin3FpiGx8xoUdJMe7iAhoFUm4f # base64 encoded private key
   ```

   To convert a private key to base64, follow these steps:
   1. List available keys: `iota keytool list`
   2. Export the key for a selected alias: `iota keytool export --key-identity [alias]`
   3. Convert the bech32 key to base64: `./utils/gas-station-tool.sh convert-key --key iotaprivatkey...`

- **External key management store (KMS)**

   **Example**:

   ```yaml
   sidecar:
      sidecar-url: https://localhost:8001
   ```

   For more details, see the [documentation](https://docs.iota.org/operator/gas-station/architecture/components#key-store-manager) and the [KMS sidecar](./sample_kms_sidecar/) example.
