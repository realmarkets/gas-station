//! This example demonstrates using the gas station to create a transaction:
//!  - Reserve gas from the gas station
//!  - Create a transaction with the gas object reserved from the gas station
//!  - Sign the transaction with the user's own key
//!  - Execute the transaction with the gas station
//!
//! Unlike `hook_with_request_headers`/`hook_with_config_headers` (which talk to this
//! service's `/v1/reserve_gas`/`/v1/execute_tx` endpoints directly through
//! [`GasStationRpcClient`]), this example instead uses
//! `iota-sdk-transaction-builder`'s own **native** gas-station support --
//! [`TransactionBuilder::gas_station_sponsor`] and
//! [`TransactionBuilder::add_gas_station_header`] -- which speaks the exact same wire
//! protocol (`/version`, `/v1/reserve_gas`, `/v1/execute_tx`) internally. This is both a
//! shorter way to write the example *and* a from-the-client-side check that this
//! service's wire contract is compatible with the upstream SDK's own gas-station client
//! (verified against `iota-sdk-transaction-builder`'s `builder/gas_station.rs` at the
//! pinned SDK revision this crate migrated to).
//!
//! Before you run this example, make sure:
//!  - `USER_PRIVATE_KEY` is set to a bech32-encoded (`iotaprivkey1...`) ed25519 private
//!    key for the account that will act as the transaction *sender* -- e.g. one printed
//!    by `iota keytool generate ed25519`. This is **not** the gas station's sponsor
//!    account: the gas station supplies its own sponsor address and gas coins via
//!    `/v1/reserve_gas`, this key only needs to own (and sign for) the object being
//!    transferred below.
//!  - `GAS_STATION_AUTH` is set to the gas station's bearer token, if it requires one.
//!  - the IOTA gas station is running and configured for TESTNET.
//!  - the sender address owns at least one IOTA coin on testnet (it's transferred to
//!    itself below, purely to have something for the sponsored transaction to do).
