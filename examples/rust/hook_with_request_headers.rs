//! This example demonstrates using the gas station to create a transaction:
//!  - Reserve gas from the gas station
//!  - Create a transaction with the gas object reserved from the gas station
//!  - Sign the transaction with the user's own key
//!  - Let an external hook decide if the transaction should be executed
//!  - Execute the transaction with the gas station, if allowed
//!
//! As this is a hook example, make sure that the example hook server from this project is
//! running (`cargo run` in the `examples/hook` folder) and that your IOTA gas station is
//! using an access controller that relies on a hook.
//!
//! This example passes headers **sent to the gas station** as **part of the payload**
//! to the hook, so no need to configure additional headers in the config, and we can
//! just use the hook's url as the action value:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! access-controller:
//!   access-policy: deny-all
//!   rules:
//!   - action: "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
//! ```
//!
//! Before you run this example, make sure:
//!  - `USER_PRIVATE_KEY` is set to a bech32-encoded (`iotaprivkey1...`) ed25519 private
//!    key for the account that will act as the transaction sender -- e.g. one printed by
//!    `iota keytool generate ed25519`.
//!  - `GAS_STATION_AUTH` is set to the gas station's bearer token, if it requires one.
//!  - the IOTA gas station is running and configured for TESTNET.
//!  - the sender address owns at least one IOTA coin on testnet (it's transferred to
//!    itself below, purely to have something for the sponsored transaction to do).
